The `Revoke-VSTSPATsJWTs.ps1` script will revoke all the PATs created before `2018-07-12T12:30:00.000Z` for the selected UPNs that have access to a VSTS account and will also expire all the JWTs for the VSTS account created before `2018-07-12T12:30:00.000Z` that have any of the `vso.packaging vso.packaging_write vso.packaging_manage` scopes. 

Enter the UPN of each user from whom you want to revoke all PATs in a text file in your local file system, one per line. 

[Create a new PAT in VSTS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=vsts#create-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate-access) by following these steps: 
1. Sign in to your VSTS account (`https://{your_vsts_account}.visualstudio.com`). 
2. From the top right of your home page, select your `Profile Picture` and go to `Security`. 
3. On the left pane select `Personal access tokens` and in the center pane select `Add`. 
4. Enter a `Description` for your new PAT, select the shortest expiration period for the `Expires In` field, and select `{your_vsts_account}` in the `Accounts` field. 
5. For `Authorized Scopes` choose `All scopes` and select `Create`. 
6. Copy the PAT text displayed in the list of tokens. 

Then you can use the PowerShell script with the following parameters: 
```PowerShell
.\Revoke-VSTSPATsJWTs.ps1 -VSTSAccountName '{your_vsts_account}' -PAT '{your_new_pat}' [-UPNsFileLocation '{location_of_your_UPNs_file}']
```

For example: 
```PowerShell
.\Revoke-VSTSPATsJWTs.ps1 -VSTSAccountName 'fabrikam' -PAT '{PAT_text}' -UPNsFileLocation '.\SampleUPNs.txt'
```

If the UPN you used to create the PAT is in the UPNs file and the PAT was created before `2018-07-12T12:30:00.000Z`, your PAT will also be removed. 

If the text file with the UPNs is not provided to the script or if the file is empty, the script will only expire the VSTS account JWTs.
